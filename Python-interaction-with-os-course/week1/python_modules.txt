 ##
- python modules can be small segments of code in order to be reused
- python modules can be imported in the file at the top of the script

* - init.py file is a special file and is read when the file gets imported. 
This is used by the interpreter to check if a directory with Python files 
should be a module

- without init.py the interpreter will not know that directory is a module
